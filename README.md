# Weather-Pattern-Plotting

## Overview:
This project is based on an assignment from Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python by University of Michigan on Coursera. This project is going to present temperature changes, comparing the data in 2015 and the last ten years (2005 to 2014). It will be discussed through a visualization of a line chart that will display the record high and lows of each month from 2005 to 2014. It will also superimpose a scatterplot of record high and lows from 2015 that either exceed the previous records.

## Dataset:
The dataset used is downloaded from Coursera website. The original source of the data is The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network ( GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.  Each row in the datafile corresponds to a single observation on daily record temperature as reported by weather stations located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States, and the stations the data comes from are shown on the map below.

##  The data visualization performs the following:
•	It returns a line graph of record high and low temperatures by day of year over period 2005-2014. The area between the record high and record low temperatures for each day of the year is shaded.

•	Overlays a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (high and lows) for which the ten-year record (2005-2014) high and low was broken in 2015.

## Step:
•	Import necessary libraries dataset (Import Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

•	Data preparation and analysis 

•	Generate Data Visualization

## Results:

In summary, I’ve shown what is the data visualization looks like using Python’ Matplotlib library.  Using the Alberto Cairo’ Visualization Wheel criteria, I will present it down below. The visual effectively leverages the guidelines of beauty, truthfulness, functionality, insightfulness, which is given for effective visual design.
